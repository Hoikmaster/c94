            The Left Bank café is furnished with sleek wood paneling and leather
            armchairs. Patrons sip espresso from china cups and nibble on
            croissants and pastries. So what are those golden arches doing on
            the sign outside the door? The coffee shop on Paris' rue Linois is
            one of 200 "McCafés" McDonald's is opening in Europe this year. By
            yearend, McDonald's hopes to have some 1,100 of the cafés across
            Europe. The cafés are located inside existing restaurants but with a
            separate counter, comfy furnishings, and nary a Big Mac in sight.
            Next year, the company plans 200 more, with an eye toward becoming
            "the No. 1 coffee seller in Europe," says Jerome Tafani, the
            company's chief financial officer for the region. That's a grande
            order. Starbucks is currently Europe's top coffee chain with nearly
            1,200 stores. But McDonald's strategy of opening McCafés in existing
            franchises gives it a leg up over the Seattle-based java king. A
            stand-alone Starbucks in Europe requires an investment of
            $350,000-plus, at least triple what a McCafé costs, says Jeffrey
            Young, managing director of London management consultancy Allegra
            Strategies. "McDonald's finally woke up and smelled the coffee,"
            says Young. "With the number of outlets it already has in place, it
            can take Starbucks head-on." McDonald's is rushing to grab market
            share where Starbucks has hesitated. While Starbucks continues to
            avoid Italy, for instance, McDonald's opened its first Italian
            McCafé in Milan in 2005. Today it has 65 of them across the country.
            And McDonald's is undercutting Starbucks on price. At McCafés in
            Paris, an espresso costs $2.50 (€1.70), vs. $2.80 (€1.90) at
            Starbucks. That's not to say you'll find McCafés everywhere. In
            Britain, where Starbucks has 700-plus stores, McDonald's has no
            plans for McCafés. And while all 13,900 U.S. McDonald's outlets now
            sell McCafé coffees, the company isn't building separate café
            sections there, either. Since 70 percent of orders come from the
            drive-through window, franchisees don't want to install a second
            counter. But in Europe, where fast food is a bit slower than across
            the Atlantic, fewer than half of McDonald's orders are to-go. Can
            McDonald's Shake its Fast-Food Image? European franchisees like
            McCafés because they encourage customers to stop in for breakfast
            and during off-peak hours. Store revenues jump 20 percent to 25
            percent after adding a new McCafé, says Michael Heinritzi,
            McDonald's No. 1 European franchisee, with nearly 40 stores across
            Germany and Austria. And the cafés increase McDonald's appeal to
            women. "It's impossible to bring [children] to a traditional French
            café," says Nelly Bourji, a Parisian who drops in at a McCafé once a
            week. "You can't all fit around the tiny tables." As for Starbucks,
            she says, "There are too many teenagers." Bourji isn't the only
            Starbucks loyalist to jump ship. At a McCafé on the Autobahn near
            Munich, former Starbucks patron Tobias Ullmann is sipping a mocha
            frappé. The restaurant features a gas fireplace inside and three
            terraces with views of the Alps. "I always stop here on my way to
            Austria or Italy," says Ullmann, an insurance agent from the German
            city of Ingolstadt. Still, one of the biggest challenges for
            McDonald's will be to shake off its fast-food image. For some, the
            idea of lingering in a McCafé remains unthinkable. "I don't care how
            good their coffee is," says Parisian Jessica Dollé, 18. "The smell
            when you walk into a McDonald's is so greasy, it's nauseating."
