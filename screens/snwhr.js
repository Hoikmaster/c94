            Undoubtedly, Spider-Man: No Way Home is one of the most highly
            anticipated films of 2021 and perhaps one of the most exciting
            releases from Marvel Studios to date. Not only is it not just
            another Spider-Man film, but the character himself is also hugely
            polarizing in mainstream media. It’s also a film that carries much
            higher expectations than any of the previous releases from both
            Spider-Man films and potentially any MCU film before it, all because
            it’s the film that will give leeway to the crossover many Spider-Man
            fans have wanted to see since the comic book storyline was published
            in 2014; the Live-Action Spider-Verse with the three modern live
            adaptations of Spider-Man. Not only will fans expect to see Tobey
            Maguire and Andrew Garfield‘s interpretations of the web-slinger
            return to the big screen, but they’ll also bring along the villains
            (and potentially other characters) from their respective films.
            Willem Dafoe‘s Green Goblin, Alfred Molina‘s Doc Ock, Jamie Foxx‘s
            Electro, Rhys Ifans‘ Lizard, and Thomas Hayden Church‘s Sandman; all
            reuniting to take on the three live-action Spider-Men in an amazing
            reunion of the most sensationalist fashion. This begs the question:
            After delivering what is arguably the most ambitious Spider-Man
            story told via this medium, what comes next? Now, bear in mind that
            what I’m about to discuss should be taken as a rumor that comes from
            a number of sources who I believe have a level of credibility. This
            rumor came to me several months ago (as our Editor-In-Chief Lizzie
            Hill can attest) following when Disney and Sony reached a deal
            regarding the streaming rights to Spider-Man and other films for the
            Disney+ catalog. In discussing the rumor with Lizzie, we felt it was
            best to approach these exciting potential plans with caution due to
            the massive implications. However, given the latest Disney+ Day
            announcements, we decided it would be something the fans would be
            very interested and excited to hear and talk about in terms of
            Spidey’s future in the MCU. With that being said, let’s delve into
            it. The rumor I heard is that Disney and Sony reaching that
            Spider-Man streaming deal was the first stepping stone in further
            strengthing the relationship between the two companies. The premise
            is that following the release of Spider-Man: No Way Home, Peter
            Parker’s story will continue in an alternating format. Marvel
            Studios seems to be planning to expand his story by having the usual
            three live-action film trilogy for the character along with three
            seasons of a Spider-Man Disney+ show, where each season will fill in
            the gap between each movie release. The first could very well be the
            newly announced Spider-Man: Freshman Year, a show that will serve as
            the MCU Peter Parker’s origin story. In this scenario, the separate
            seasons may be given a different name of course, but potentially may
            be led by the same team from Spider-Man: Freshman Year. It would
            just be moving forward in time for Peter to go along with and fill
            in between the films. To help you visualize what could happen (if
            these rumored plans I heard about are accurate) see below: Freshman
            Year (Season 1) Spider-Man 4 (TBD) Spider-Man (TBD) Disney+ (Season
            2) Spider-Man 5 (TBD) Spider-Man (TBD) Disney+ (Season 3) Spider-Man
            6 (TBD) Spider-Man is a character that can “attempt” to set up a
            cinematic universe of his own. Just look at Sony’s Spider-Man
            Universe with Venom, Morbius, and Kraven the Hunter. Beyond the pun,
            however, Spider-Man’s rogues’ gallery and comic book source material
            are so vast that trying to explore all of it within a two-hour
            timeframe is an uphill battle. It’s why the most praised Spider-Man
            projects out there are projects like The Spectacular Spider-Man
            series and Marvel’s Spider-Man PS4 video game. Should Marvel and
            Sony go for this route for Spidey’s future, they could find great
            success in developing the character further than ever before. It
            allows Peter Parker’s story as Spider-Man to span an even longer
            accumulative runtime than any other previous MCU character. This
            fundamental characteristic could improve the MCU Spidey’s
            relationship with the fans, making it all the more emotional the
            moment Peter Parker’s story eventually ends in the MCU.
