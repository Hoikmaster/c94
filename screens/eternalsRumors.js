            Eternals is shaping up to be an exciting project in the MCU. Here
            are some rumors we hope are true for the series (& some we don't
            want to be true). Phase 4 of the MCU will finally be starting this
            year with Black Widow this summer. However, later in the year, we
            will be introduced to one of the MCU's most interesting and exciting
            new franchises with the release of Eternals. Eternals is directed by
            Chloé Zhao and stars Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Richard Madden
            and more in the story of ancient cosmic beings who have been living
            amongst humans for thousands of years. While the project is being
            kept very secretive, there are plenty of rumors already swirling.
            Here are some rumors about Eternals we hope are true and some we
            hope are not. 10 Hope Is True: Maelstrom Is The Villain Details
            about this movie are being kept so tightly guarded that we're still
            not entirely sure who will be playing heroes and who will be playing
            villains. However, one villain character that is being rumored to be
            featured is exciting for the film and the future of the MCU.
            Maelstrom is a villain from the comics, Maelstrom is an Inhuman
            character who lived amongst the Deviants. With the Deviants said to
            be the main threat in the film, there is a lot of speculation that
            Maelstrom will be the main antagonist who can then go on to be a
            threat in further films. 9 Hope Isn't True: Creating Of The Mutants
            The introduction of the Eternals will no doubt be a game-changing
            event in the MCU. These are all-powerful beings who have been hiding
            in plain sight for years who are set to finally emerge and reveal
            themselves to the world. Given how significant this could be, the
            theories that they will also help bring mutants into the MCU seems
            to be pushing for too much. With the X-Men now a part of the MCU, it
            will be interesting to see how mutants are explained. But for them
            to be shoehorned into this film seems like a bad idea. 8 Hope Is
            True: The Snap Knowing that the Eternals have been there this whole
            time begs the obvious question of why they haven't stepped in to
            help out before. When Loki attacked Earth or Thanos wiped out half
            of the universe, those seemed like good times to show themselves.
            However, rumors have it that decision will play directly into the
            storyline of the film. Some rumors suggest that given the damage
            that Thanos committed, the other Eternals are seen as a threat that
            the Celestials decide to eliminate. It could be an interesting way
            of bringing them into the wider world of the MCU. 7 Hope Isn't: Baby
            Thanos Thanos is connected to the Eternals in the comic books and
            many are wondering if those connections will stand in the movie as
            well. The backstory we know from Thanos thus far in the MCU doesn't
            mention anything about the Eternals, but given the timespan of this
            movie, there are rumors a young Thanos could appear. Thanos is
            clearly an interesting villain and one worth exploring more but now
            doesn't seem like the right time. We just saw him defeated in
            Avengers: Endgame so what would be the point in exploring his past
            now? Better to focus on new characters. 6 Hope Is True: Celestials
            Appear In the comics, Celestials are godlike beings who are
            responsible for creating the Eternals to protect humankind from the
            Deviants. It has been confirmed that the Celestials will play a role
            in this film which means we could see some familiar faces returning.
            In the movies, one Celestial we have met so far is Ego, played by
            Kurt Russell in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. It would be a lot of
            fun to see him pop up in the movie even for just a quick cameo. 5
            Hope Isn't True: Retconning It can be a lot of fun to explore the
            MCU's past and discover new secrets. However, we hope that the story
            doesn't get too carried away with reshaping things that we already
            know. If certain rumors are true, there could be aspects of the MCU
            that are retconned through this film. Some of the things that have
            been rumored to be addressed in Eternals include Asgardians,
            Infinity Stones, and various Earth-bound events of previous films.
            If they start playing around with what's already established, it
            could make for a big continuity mess. 4 Hope Is True: Hercules
            Appears Along with the Eternal characters like Ikaris and Sersi who
            will be introduced in this movie, there are some non-Eternal
            characters set to join the MCU. It has been confirmed that Kit
            Harrington will be playing Dane Whitman in the film who goes on to
            become the hero Black Knight. However, one other rumored hero is
            even more exciting. Some reports suggest the film will also bring
            Hercules into the MCU. Hercules has been a key member of the
            Avengers in the comics and this seems like the perfect opportunity
            to introduce a character that would be hard to bring in any other
            way. 3 Hope Isn't True: Namor To Appear Given the centuries-spanning
            and secret-revealing nature of the Eternals storyline, there have
            been plenty of rumors about other heroes that might pop up in the
            movie. While it would be easy for the movie to introduce just about
            any hero, some are better left alone for now. Namor is another hero
            whose name has been linked to this movie. Though Namor is a
            fascinating hero we'd love to see in the MCU eventually, it would
            feel a little rushed to introduce such a complex character in a
            cameo in this film. 2 Hope Is True: Secrets Of The MCU One of the
            most exciting aspects of the film is the fact that it will
            reportedly span thousands of years throughout the universe. While it
            will be fun to see the Eternals in a modern setting, there are so
            many possibilities for where the story can go by exploring the past.
            Though the Eternals might not be well-known characters, rumors
            suggest this movie might be very important for the future of the
            MCU. It is thought that the secrets of the MCU's past will be
            revealed and change things forever going forward. 1 Hope Isn't True:
            Setting Up Too Much The thing that makes Eternals such an exciting
            project is also the thing that makes us worry the most. Even with so
            much success to date, this feels like such an ambitious project for
            the MCU. From the characters who are virtually unknown to the
            massive timeline to the exciting new storylines, there seems like a
            lot to pack into one film. Some rumors suggest this movie is meant
            to kick-start a new chapter in the MCU and has been compared to Iron
            Man in terms of its importance to the MCU. That's a lot of pressure
            to put on the film so hopefully, they are allowing it to exist as
            its own story as well.
