            10 Best Places to Visit in Texas They say that everything is bigger
            in Texas, and it is certainly true that there is a large range of
            things do so, see and explore in the second largest state. Texans
            are fiercely proud, and they have a lot to be proud of. Whether
            you’re interested in history, art or cowboy culture, it’s all found
            in Texas. As you plan your upcoming trip to the Lone Star State, be
            sure to checkout this list of best places to visit in Texas. 10.
            Palo Duro Canyon Cutting through the High Plains region of Texas is
            the Palo Duro Canyon, the second largest in the United States, after
            the Grand Canyon. Red rock is exposed, creating a beautiful sight to
            behold, but the canyon is more than just a void. It is also where
            Native American tribes like the Apache and the Comanche once called
            home. There is an abundance of wildlife in the park, so as you hike
            the miles of trails, keep your eyes peeled for things like Aoudad
            sheep, whitetail deer and even mountain lions. You can also ride
            horses and dine on chuckwagon cuisine in and around the canyon. 9.
            El Paso El Paso Right on the Mexican border in the far western
            corner of Texas is a city called El Paso. This destination is also
            known as Sun City, and it boasts incredible views as the sun sets
            nightly over the Franklin Mountains. There are many great
            attractions in El Paso, just some of which include the Chihuahuan
            Desert Gardens, the Museum of Archeology at Wilderness Park and the
            Centennial Museum. El Paso offers plenty of opportunities to get
            active outdoors, so don’t miss the chance to hike along the El Paso
            Mission Trail, picnic in view of McKelligon Canyon or drive along
            the scenic Transmountain Road. Trips to Ciudad Juarez just across
            the border were once popular but have become to dangerous due to
            drug-related violence. 8. Big Bend National Park Big Bend National
            Park Although Big Bend National Park is one of the least-visited
            parks in the United States, it is a jewel in the heart of Texas and
            a must-see destination. The park is enormous, and borders the Rio
            Grand River. The park was once underwater, and dinosaur fossils
            speak to the history of the region. There are miles of scenic drives
            throughout Big Bend National Park, but hiking is an even better way
            to see the rock formations and landscape up close. Try an east
            stroll along Window View Trail, the more challenging Chimneys Trail
            or just a relaxing float down the river instead. 7. Dallas Dallas
            Making up a significant portion of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex
            is Dallas, the state’s third largest city. Dallas is probably best
            known for the infamous assassination of former U.S. President John
            F. Kennedy. Located in the same building from which Lee Harvey
            Oswald fired the shots, the Sixth Floor Museum is dedicated to the
            assassination. The city is a shopper’s dream thanks to more stores
            per capita than any other American city. You can also visit one of
            the many amusement parks in Dallas or attend a local rodeo for some
            local Texas flavor. 6. Galveston Less than an hour’s drive south of
            the city of Houston is Galveston, a coastal retreat on the shores of
            the Gulf of Mexico. As a popular vacation spot, Galveston boasts
            miles of sandy coastline and unending dining, shopping and nightlife
            options. While you’re in Galveston, don’t forget to check out the
            older architecture of the Strand National Historic Landmark
            District, stroll through the incredible indoor Moody Gardens or
            explore aviation history at the Lone Star Flight Museum. Galveston
            is the perfect place to make a splash, so don’t miss the free
            Bolivar Ferry rides or a walk along Pleasure Pier. 5. Texas Hill
            Country In the very center of Texas is Hill County, where a variety
            of cultures combine to create a melting pot of history, heritage and
            cuisine. Enjoy the natural beauty of the region at Enchanted Rock
            State Natural Area, ideal for hiking and camping, or the Hill
            Country State Natural Area, which is a favorite for swimming and
            fishing. Head to Fredericksburg for a dose of German culture, since
            the area was settled by German settlers in the 19th century. In
            Fredericksburg, you might visit a winery for a tasting, enjoy
            bratwurst and sauerkraut at an authentic beer garden or shop for
            Bavarian souvenirs at an outdoor market. The best time to visit the
            region is in spring when the Hill Country is ablaze with wildflowers
            including the Texas State Flower; the Bluebonnet. 4. Padre Island
            National Seashore A small, thin island extends parallel to the coast
            of Texas, stretching all the way from Corpus Christi to the Mexican
            border. Surrounded by the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, this is
            known as Padre Island. The bulk of the island itself is made up of
            the Padre Island National Seashore, a protected treasure where you
            can see blue waters in virtually any direction you turn. Filled with
            wildlife, and an important spot for bird watching in Texas, the
            Padre Island National Seashore leads to South Padre Island, a
            popular getaway spot for beach vacations, family fun and serious
            nightlife. 3. Austin Known for its slogan, “Keep Austin Weird,” this
            city definitely feels a little different from the rest of Texas. The
            population is youthful, thanks in part to the enormous campus of the
            University of Texas, and it also serves as the Live Music Capital of
            the country. Austin is the capital of the Lone Star State, so don’t
            miss the chance to tour the capitol building, which is famously pink
            and even taller than the U.S. Capitol Building. Also worth exploring
            is the LBJ Presidential Library, the stunning paths that wind along
            Barton Creek and the Congress Avenue Bridge, where you can see more
            than one million bats fly out at sunset, creating an unforgettable
            event that locals know is a must-do in Austin. 2. Houston As the
            biggest city in Texas, Houston is one of the most popular places to
            visit in Texas. Famously known for being home to the NASA Mission
            Control Center, Houston is also where you’ll find places like the
            beautiful campus of Rice University and the high-end shopping of the
            Galleria Area. Many of the city’s biggest attractions are located in
            the Warehouse District of Downtown Houston, so head there to see the
            incredible Downtown Tunnel System, soak in the views from the 60th
            floor Chase Tower Observatory, explore the Downtown Aquarium and
            catch an outdoor performance at TUTS, or the Theater Under the
            Stars. 1. San Antonio The third largest city in Texas is San
            Antonio, which is nestled in the South Texas Plains. San Antonio’s
            heartbeat is its downtown, thanks to an abundance of restaurants and
            nightlife options. Nestled in by tall buildings and cypress trees,
            and tucked away from the noise of traffic above, the River Walk
            draws huge numbers of tourists to its boutique hotels, specialty
            shops, and plethora of restaurants with open-air dining. Downtown is
            also home to the famed Alamo, a national landmark where the iconic
            Battle of the Alamo was fought. For more history, check out the many
            19th century homes in the King William Historic Area, tour the Casa
            Navarro State Historical Park or admire the extensive collection at
            the Institute of Texan Cultures.
