            In an industry that seems to move at the speed of light, it is
            shocking to see production around the world progress at a snail’s
            pace. No one has been able to escape the global shortage of
            semiconductor chips. The automobile industry will lose $210 billion
            in revenue because of the lack of computer chips, according to one
            recent report. Game console makers have missed targets. Even the
            seemingly unstoppable smartphone manufacturers are facing slowdowns.
            In over three decades in the semiconductor and optoelectronics
            industry, I have never seen supply fall so far short of meeting
            demand. The industry is notorious for going through global
            boom-and-bust cycles, but the current situation is largely a result
            of the pandemic. When so many of us began to work from home, we
            found ourselves suddenly wanting laptops. For the first time in
            years, there was a spike in personal computer shipments in 2020.
            Annual PC sales shot up by 11% compared to 2019, making it the
            biggest growth year in a decade and putting strain on silicon chip
            manufacturers. What we did with those laptops also contributed to
            the slowdown. More people have routers and broadband and are using
            more data for Zoom calls, FaceTime chats or streaming all kinds of
            entertainment. That all leads to a disruption in supply and an
            increase in use, resulting in depleted inventory across the
            industry. While the pandemic changed our work habits and confined
            many of us to home, it also restricted chip makers from scaling up
            fast enough to satisfy the public’s hunger for more speed. Mandates
            on social distancing and indoor occupancy has meant manufacturers
            could not fully staff their operations for much of the past 18
            months. You can’t play catch-up in a competition when you’re down
            half your team. Yet, that’s what the industry has been challenged to
            do. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users

            affects various aspects of our lives, and semiconductors touch
            pretty much every part of life in the 21st century. The demand for
            all things digital has gone into overdrive, which has left me and
            many of my industry colleagues stunned. Even foundries that have
            traditionally had excess capacity are oversubscribed, meaning many
            products will be delayed for months ahead. It has been grim days for
            hitting deadlines, for sure. An End To The Chip Shortage But there
            are hopeful signs and even silver linings to these bleak and
            frustrating times. Chip manufacturers are building inventory and
            operating at a higher capacity than they normally would. The result
            will likely be an overcorrection. As the Covid-19 crisis wanes, I
            see an end to the shortage occurring because suppliers are already
            expanding their capacity. Plus, as more and more people return to
            work and to a daily routine that is less connected, that feverish
            demand for data will decrease. Necessity inspires innovation, of
            course, and that’s also one of the positive developments of the past
            year. The shift toward hybrid integration in the photonics industry
            has led to technology that can reduce the number of components
            assembled at the wafer level. According to ZDnet.com, “There are up
            to 1,400 steps in the overall manufacturing process for
            semiconductor wafers; it can take as long as 20 weeks to complete
            advanced chips, and fabs can use as many as 300 different types of
            materials throughout fabrication.” But hybrid integration allows for
            miniaturization of the assembly process. That shift in design
            reduces the bill of materials, meaning less components are required
            and costs are lowered, so manufacturers aren’t spread so thin. With
            the adoption of more fifth-generation (5G) devices, innovation will
            be essential as we accelerate toward the next wave of digital
            solutions. How To Mitigate Delays Now Hybrid integration is on track
            to impact the industry in notable ways in 2022. Until we get there,
            companies ensnared in the supply-chain backlog can implement some
            sensible measures to mitigate the delays. One of the first things
            that can be done is to procure qualified secondary vendors who can
            help fill the gap when your primary supplier is unable to deliver.
            That is a step we took at POET Technologies in the spring and it has
            helped us limit the delays toward the commercialization of our
            products. Another step is to find ways to make your current
            processes more efficient. For example, Volkswagen recently said that
            automakers will try to reduce the number of chips used in
            manufacturing and focus on using smaller, more powerful modules as a
            way to deal with the depletion. Heavy Investment Brightens The
            Future The brightest hope to prevent future shortages is the sudden
            heavy investment in the development and manufacturing of chips. Some
            of the world’s largest tech companies have launched their own chip
            factories, in part to protect themselves against future slowdowns.
            In addition, Silicon Valley, seeing the unmet demand, has flooded
            the industry with funding. According to Crunchbase, more than $3.7
            billion in venture capital has been invested in semiconductor
            companies this year. On top of private funding, governments have
            promised gigantic investments to increase domestic chip-making. In
            May, the United States formed the Semiconductors in America
            Coalition (SIAC) and is seeking to spend $50 billion to boost
            manufacturing in the country. It is an investment that could end
            U.S. dependence on foreign chip makers. According to the SIAC, in
            1990, the U.S. was responsible for 37% of global semiconductor
            manufacturing capacity, but that figure has tumbled to 12% in 2021.
            Europe is also planning to increase spending on chip-making, which
            will lead to increased production capability by the end of this
            decade. While the global semiconductor and optoelectronics industry
            has been trudging through an unprecedented depletion of key
            materials that run the world’s machines and devices, it has also
            demonstrated resilience. I believe there are indications that the
            world will return to a stronger, better-prepared new normal in 2022.
            Soon enough, we’ll be reaching manufacturing targets at such
            dizzying levels it will seem like we are indeed propelling at light
            speed.
